# Book List Web App
This web app allows a user to add books to the user's own list. There are features such as searching for a book in your list by author or book title, sorting the list alphabetically by author or book title, exporting your list to a CSV or XML file, etc. The web app was built using Laravel 8.
# Installation 
To run the application, 
 - First, download Laravel Homestead - https://laravel.com/docs/8.x/installation. I found this youtube tutorials helpful -https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b3HLNJvVzNo&ab_channel=QuentinWattTutorials (watch parts 1-4). 
    - Note, configuring homestead.yaml can be tricky. Here is a screenshot of my homestead.yaml folders and sites mapping: 
    
 - Second, make your way into the Laravel project folder where the Book List Web App lives. Use this tutorial to get all setup: https://devmarketer.io/learn/setup-laravel-project-cloned-github-com/ (parts 1-10 are most relevant). 
    - Setting up the .env file can also be tricky. Make sure your DB_USERNAME=homestead and DB_PASSWORD=secret. 
    - Note, you can run either `php artisan migrate` or `php artisan migrate:refresh` for part 10. 
 - Lastly, run `php artisan serve` and go to the url given from the terminal.
